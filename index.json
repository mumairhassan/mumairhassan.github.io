First, we used CNN-based feature extraction and then parallelly we used SIFT-based feature extraction for the same query image. At CNN level we used R-MAC detection followed by sum-pooling, and then we calculated the similarity score using L2 distance. T-embedding and democratic aggregation followed the SIFT and similarity score calculated further added with a CNN-based similarity score, and we applied query expansion to check the accuracy of the proposed pipeline comparing it with other state-of-the-art methods. The newly added annotations and original annotations were used and set as testbeds for the comparisons and found that image retrieval is still a challenging problem for new upcoming retrieval tasks.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"A framework for the revision of large-scale image retrieval benchmarks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Muhammad Umair Hassan"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.
